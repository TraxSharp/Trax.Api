# A misconfigured host fails at startup, not at request time

When a host wires Trax's GraphQL surface wrongly, it throws while starting, with a message
naming the call to change. It does not build a schema that looks fine and then fails on the
request that happens to touch the broken part.

**Five** validators enforce it: `QueryModelAuthorizationSchemaValidator`,
`QueryModelAuthorizationValidator`, `TraxOperationsServiceValidator`,
`TraxSubscriptionAuthWiringValidator` and `TraxGraphQLAuthPolicyValidator`. Each is an
`IHostedService`, so it runs after the container is complete and sees the truth regardless
of the order the host registered anything in, and each names the call to change.

`QueryModelScalarCollectionIndexValidator` sits in the same folder and is **not** one of
them: it is advisory, logs a warning about a missing GIN index and never blocks startup. A
query-plan hint is not a misconfiguration. `GraphQLClientStartupValidator` in
`Trax.Api.GraphQL.Client.Trax` applies the same policy to outbound schema drift, which is a
different surface and is not counted here either.

## Status

**Accepted.**

## Considered options

**Throwing from the registration extension itself.** Simpler, and wrong for most of these
checks: `AddTraxGraphQL()` runs partway through the host's startup code, so anything it
concludes from the `IServiceCollection` is a statement about where the caller happens to be,
not about the finished container. See
[0002](./0002-reading-the-service-collection-is-order-dependent.md).

**Letting it fail at request time**, which is what happens by default. The failure arrives
masked as an "Unexpected Execution Error" on one operation, pointing at a resolver rather
than at the missing registration three files away in `Program.cs`. For the subscription
case it did not fail at all: HotChocolate's default interceptor accepted every
`connection_init`, so subscriptions silently stopped authenticating while HTTP kept working.

## Consequences

**The message is part of the contract.** A validator that throws without naming the call to
add is only marginally better than the request-time failure it replaced. `TraxOperationsServiceValidator`
names `ExposeOperationQueries` and the services to register; the subscription one names the
ordering to fix.

**Startup cost is paid only where there is something to check.**
`QueryModelAuthorizationSchemaValidator` materialises the whole schema at boot, so it is
registered only when the host has at least one `[TraxAuthorize]` or `[TraxAllowAnonymous]`
query model. A host with neither never pays for it.

**It checks both directions.** A gated entity that lost `@authorize` fails the host, and so
does an anonymous one that gained it. The escape hatch it closes is a consumer's
`ConfigureSchema` callback, which runs after Trax's own wiring and has full builder access by
design, so it is the one place Trax cannot control.

## Exemplars

- `TraxOperationsServiceValidatorTests` pins the fail-fast behaviour for the operations
  surface, including the message.
- `QueryModelAuthorizeSchemaValidatorTests` drives the schema validator directly: it asserts
  the host throws naming the entity, the type or the entry field when a directive is stripped
  in each of the three ways, and does not throw when they are intact.
- [Registration Order](/docs/reference/registration-order) is the user-facing statement of
  what order matters and what happens when it is wrong.

Not covered:

- Nothing checks that a new piece of host configuration *has* a validator. Adding a surface
  that can be half-wired and forgetting the check is invisible to the build, and that is the
  failure mode this ADR is about.
- `QueryModelAuthorizeSchemaInvariantE2ETests.cs` is the end-to-end half of the same story, but
  its only assertion is that the host is not null, which cannot fail. It also needs a live
  Postgres and fails rather than skipping without one. Read it as a smoke test, not as
  coverage.
