> Part of [Trax](https://github.com/TraxSharp): business logic you can call, schedule, or serve as an API, with every
> run recorded in your Postgres. [Docs](https://traxsharp.net/docs) · [Getting started](https://traxsharp.net/docs/getting-started) · [All repos](https://github.com/TraxSharp)

Trax.Api generates a typed GraphQL API from your trains and `[TraxQueryModel]` entities, with fail-closed
authorization, request audit and typed clients. It builds on [Trax.Scheduler](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Scheduler)
and runs on HotChocolate; [Trax.Dashboard](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Dashboard) builds on it.

## Install

```bash
dotnet add package Trax.Api.GraphQL
dotnet add package Trax.Effect.Data.Postgres   # storage for the run records and the work queue
dotnet add package Trax.Api.Auth.ApiKey        # or Trax.Api.Auth.Jwt, Trax.Api.Auth.Oidc
```

## Example

Adapted from the game server sample. Two attributes put the leaderboard train on the schema as a queued mutation:

```csharp
[TraxMutation(GraphQLOperation.Queue)]
[TraxAuthorize(Roles = "Admin")]
public class RecalculateLeaderboardTrain
    : ServiceTrain<RecalculateLeaderboardInput, RecalculateLeaderboardOutput>,
        IRecalculateLeaderboardTrain

// Program.cs: Trax, an auth scheme, and the GraphQL endpoint gated behind it
builder.Services.AddTrax(trax =>
    trax.AddEffects(effects => effects.UsePostgres(connectionString))
        .AddMediator(typeof(Program).Assembly));

// Keys come from your secret manager, never from source control.
builder.Services.AddTraxApiKeyAuth(keys => keys
    .Add(builder.Configuration["ApiKeys:Admin"]!, id: "admin", "Admin"));
builder.Services.AddAuthorization();
builder.Services.AddTraxGraphQL(graphql => graphql.RequireAuthorization());

var app = builder.Build();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
app.UseTraxGraphQL();   // maps at /trax/graphql
```

```graphql
mutation {
  dispatch {
    recalculateLeaderboard(input: { region: "na" }) {
      workQueueId
    }
  }
}
```

A caller without the `Admin` role gets a `TRAX_AUTHORIZATION` error. An exposed train that declares neither
`[TraxAuthorize]` nor `[TraxAllowAnonymous]` stops the host from starting.

## Where this fits

Trax is split into layers, one repo each. Take the ones you need; the trains you wrote do not change. **You are here: Trax.Api.**

| Repo | What it adds |
|---|---|
| [Trax.Core](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Core) | Trains, junctions and the chain, with no database and no DI container |
| [Trax.Effect](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Effect) | A recorded run for every execution (Postgres, SQLite or in memory), DI, effect providers, the state-machine engine |
| [Trax.Mediator](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Mediator) | The train bus: run a train by handing over its input, with every chain checked at startup |
| [Trax.Scheduler](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Scheduler) | Cron and interval schedules, retries, dead letters, and workers on other machines or in Lambda |
| **[Trax.Api](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Api)** | **GraphQL generated from your trains, with authentication, audit and typed clients** |
| [Trax.Dashboard](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Dashboard) | A Blazor Server UI for runs, schedules and dead letters, mounted in your app |
| [Trax.Cli](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Cli) | The `trax` tool: scaffold a hub and trains from an OpenAPI or GraphQL schema, and state-machine codegen |
| [Trax.Samples](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Samples) | Complete sample apps, and the `trax-api`, `trax-scheduler` and `trax-hub` templates |
